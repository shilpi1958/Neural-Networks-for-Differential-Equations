# Neural-Networks-for-Time-independent schroedinger equation

Aim: to solve the Time-independent schroedinger equation using Deep learning techniques.
Time-independent schroedinger equation is a second-order differential equation whose boundary conditions depend on the potential field.\

We largely follow the article

Here, relation between potential fields and ground state is found using DL , thus solving the Time-independent schroedinger equation!
