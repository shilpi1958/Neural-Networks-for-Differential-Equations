Aim: to solve the Time-independent schroedinger equation using Deep learning techniques.
Time-independent schroedinger equation is a second-order differential equation whose boundary conditions depend on the potential field.\

We largely follow the article
"Artificial Neural Networks for Solving Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, I. E. Lagaris, A. Likas and D. I. Fotiadis, 1997" <br>
